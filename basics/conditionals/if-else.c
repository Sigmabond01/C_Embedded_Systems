/*
The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true, 
it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false, 
it wonâ€™t. But what if we want to do something else when the condition
is false? Here comes the C else statement. 
We can use the else statement with the if statement to execute
a block of code when the condition is false. 
The if-else statement consists of two blocks, one for false expression and one for true expression.
