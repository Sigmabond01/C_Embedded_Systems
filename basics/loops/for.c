/*
for loop is an entry-controlled loop, which means that the condition is checked before the loop's body executes.

The various parts of the for loop are:
Initialization: Initialize the variable to some initial value.
Test Condition: This specifies the test condition. If the condition evaluates to true, then body of the loop is executed. If evaluated false, loop is terminated.
Update Expression: After the execution loopâ€™s body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value.
Body of Loop: Statements to repeat. Generally enclosed inside {} braces.
